What is the Repository Pattern
******************************

The Repository design pattern facilitates de-coupling of business logic and  Data Access Layers of an application with the former not having any knowledge regarding data persistence.
    
    "Mediates between the domain and data mapping layers using a collection-like interface for accessing domain objects."
        -- Martin Fowler
